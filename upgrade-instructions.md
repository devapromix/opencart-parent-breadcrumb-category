# Upgrade Instructions #

* Download the .ocmod.zip (either from OpenCart Marketplace, or Github and ensure you have the latest version number; unless you wish to downgrade) and upload it similarly to how you did while initially installing

***
**Opencart 2.3.0.2:**
* You will be prompted with a list of files that will be "replaced" (all will be files native to this extension; click Continue to proceed)

***
**BOTH Opencart 2.3.0.2 and 3.0.2.0:**
* Head to Modifications on the navigation menu -> **DISABLE** any previous versions of Parent Category Breadcrumbs, while leaving the latest (highest version number) active - this will not disable the **extension**, but only the old codebase that is cached by the system.
* Also in modifications, clear cache (orange button, then blue button on the right)

***
**Opencart 3.0.2.0:**
* Go to Extensions -> Installer and remove the old package (lower version numbers than what you most recently obtained from either Opencart Marketplace or Github).
* Clear & refresh modification cache once again

***
***
You should now be upgraded to the latest version.
