# Install Instructions
If you already have the extension installed & will be upgrading to a new release, follow the [upgrade instructions](upgrade-instructions.md), instead.

* Download the .zip file and in admin (left navigation menu) -> Extensions Installer
* Click Upload & select the .zip
* Clear Modifications cache (orange button, then blue button on the right):
![clear modifications](./img/clear-mods.png)

Once that is done, you should now see parent and subcategories in your product breadcrumbs!
